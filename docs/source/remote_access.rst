Remote Access
==============

Summary
-------
This is a guide for how to edit remote files on a local text editor via port-
fowarding. By the end you should know: 

* how to quickly login to your remote server using an SSH config file
* how to edit remote files in a local text editor through ``rmate``
* how to edit remote python files in a local ``jupyter`` environment

Simplifying Logins
------------------
If you use a Unix-based operating system on your personal computer, you can make use
of an SSH config file to create shortcuts to your frequently used remote computers.

Edit Remote Files Locally
-------------------------
As an alternative to remote-based text editors such as ``vi`` and ``emacs``, we can
use port-fowarding to set up a local-based text editor like ``Atom`` which includes
features such as syntax highlighting and code completion.

Edit Remote python Files in a ``jupyter`` Environment
-----------------------------------------------------
The ``jupyter`` environment is a great environent for data exploration and integrating
your figures inline with your code.
