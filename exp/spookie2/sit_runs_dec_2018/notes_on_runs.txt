The following code
https://github.com/sit23/Isca/blob/simple_clouds/exp/test_cases/socrates_test/socrates_aquaplanet_with_cloud_amip_with_topo.py

was used to create the data in this folder
/scratch/sit204/data_isca/soc_test_with_clouds_post_jm_suggestions_amip_ssts_land_mid_albedo

and this code
https://github.com/sit23/Isca/blob/simple_clouds/exp/test_cases/socrates_test/socrates_aquaplanet_with_cloud_amip_no_topo.py

was used to make this data
soc_test_with_clouds_post_jm_suggestions_amip_ssts_land_mid_albedo_flat

Both of which where used to make the plots I showed Adrian and then tested gibbs rippled plots against.
