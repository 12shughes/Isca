Isca is a framework for the idealized modelling of the global circulation of
planetary atmospheres at varying levels of complexity and realism. The
framework is an outgrowth of models from GFDL designed for Earth's atmosphere,
but it may readily be extended into other planetary regimes. Various forcing
and radiation options are available. At the simple end of the spectrum a
Held-Suarez case is available. An idealized grey radiation scheme, a grey
scheme with moisture feedback, a two-band scheme and a multi-band scheme are
also available, all with simple moist effects and astronomically-based solar
forcing. At the complex end of the spectrum the framework provides a direct
connection to comprehensive atmospheric general circulation models.

For Earth modelling, options include an aqua-planet and configurable (idealized
or realistic) continents with idealized or realistic topography. Continents may
be defined by changing albedo, heat capacity and evaporative parameters, and/or
by using a simple bucket hydrology model. Oceanic Q-fluxes may be added to
reproduce specified sea-surface temperatures, with any continents or on an
aquaplanet. Planetary atmospheres may be configured by changing planetary size,
solar forcing, atmospheric mass, radiative, and other parameters.

The underlying model is written in Fortran and may largely be configured with
Python scripts, with internal coding changes required for non-standard cases.
Python scripts are also used to run the model on different architectures, to
archive the output, and for diagnostics, graphics, and post-processing. All of
these features are publicly available on a Git-based repository.
